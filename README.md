## Checking Your Machine Specifications

### Understanding the Specifications
It's essential to have a computer that meets your bootcamp specs. Check the links for technical specifications: Web Development, Cybersecurity.

### Key Components
- **Operating System**: Software that manages hardware. Common OS include macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Processor**: The CPU is the brain of the computer that executes instructions; ensure it meets software requirements.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Short-term memory for active processes. Insufficient RAM limits multitasking capabilities.
- **Disk Size/Type**: Long-term storage measured in GB, typically HDD or SSD. SSDs are faster and more reliable.
- **Camera & Microphone**: Essential for video conferencing. Most modern laptops have built-in options.
- **Browser**: Applications to access the Internet. Use compatible browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
- **Internet Bandwidth**: Measured in Mbps, it's the capacity for data transmission. Better bandwidth improves streaming and application performance.

### Checking Your Current Computer
Determine your operating system:
- **Apple**: All run macOS. Check via **About This Mac**.
- **Windows**: Search for `msinfo32` to find system specifications.

#### Apple Computers
