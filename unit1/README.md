## What is a Professional Journal?
Journaling, whether it be personal or professional, is simply keeping track of your experiences, actions, and thoughts. A professional journal is a place to keep memorable notes, solutions to problems, and even future goals. Your journal can be unorganized and random, or structured and streamlined. Ultimately, it has to work for you and fit into your schedule!

Journaling can be used to reprogram your thoughts into a growth mindset. Use it as a place to track your milestones or process any frustrations. Journaling can be leveraged as a tool for any professional, but is especially beneficial to those seeking a change in their career.

The tech professional journal for this program is to support your development during your time at Fullstack, as well as throughout your career journey. It is a resource to track your performance and reflect. For example, you can use the journal to describe any of the following:
- How you solved a problem
- Challenges faced
- Industry interests
- Project contributions
- How you resolved a team conflict
- Justify reasons for making certain decisions about features
- How you plan out
- Strengths
- How to improve a weakness
- Workplace values
- Experiences building your confidence

While this helps you understand yourself as a developer, it can also help you become an effective job candidate for interview questions like, “What lesson did you learn working on this project?”

These small day-to-day details can get lost in your memory and are hard to recall when put on the spot during an interview. By recording and reviewing them regularly, you can better prepare yourself to respond to these questions with meaningful and impactful responses.

## Best Practices
Here are some tips for starting and sticking with professional journaling:
- **Start small.** You don't have to write a book each day; one or two sentence entries are perfectly acceptable! 
- **Make it a habit by being consistent.** Whether it be at the same time, day, or place, create a habit out of adding to and reviewing your journal. To strengthen commitment, add a calendar reminder or notification to focus.
- **Feel comfortable using outlines** if full sentences don’t move you. Mind map, use shorthand, graphs, images, or draw your ideas to help transfer your thoughts.
- **Don't lie to yourself!** Stay candid; no one is reading this but you.
- **Include both positives and negatives.** Reflect on long and short term goals and record any progress made.
- **Date all your entries.**
- **Write without editing or revising.**
- **Review and re-read your entries.**

Journaling looks different for everyone, so don't be afraid to experiment and make adjustments for what works best for you!
