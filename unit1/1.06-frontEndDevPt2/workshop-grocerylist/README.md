## Overview
You want to make grocery shopping a lot easier and decided to move it online instead of on paper. Your goal is to create an HTML file that has food photos, different categories of grocery items, and a list of the different items, which could look something like the following image:

## Grocery List Requirements
Your list needs to meet all the following requirements:
- Incorporate major HTML semantic tags.
- Each category of grocery should be in some type of "section".
- Sections should have background colors.
- Section headers should have background colors.
- The main header text needs to be a different color.
- Use three types of headings.
- Include two types of lists.
- Use the box model to add borders and spacing to each section.
- Add two photos with padding so they are nicely spaced away from the text element.
- CSS needs to be incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the header, and inline. You choose which CSS goes where.

> **Note**: It is important that you submit something before the next class session. Even if you are not done, submit your proof of progress before the next class begins.
