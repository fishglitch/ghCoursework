## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we will cover additional CSS and HTML concepts:
- Design and build a functioning HTML form with a variety of input types.
- Create functioning layouts in CSS grid and CSS flex.
- Demonstrate the use of various kinds of CSS units (px, em, rem, vw, vh, %, etc).
- Demonstrate the use of more advanced CSS selectors: media queries, nth selectors, !important, hierarchical selectors.
- Demonstrate the use of more advanced CSS rules: box-sizing, backgrounds, DOM ordering, z-index, transitions, calc, and hover.
- Identify the different elements of an HTML form: form, inputs, submit button.
- Explain the purposes of and differences between CSS grid and CSS flex.
- Explain the use and purpose of styling libraries and frameworks.

There are two types of units you can use in CSS:
- A relative unit, with the exception of percentages, is related to the viewport or font size of an element.
- An absolute unit will always be the same, regardless of the viewport or font size.

### Quick Unit Reference Guide
| Unit | Description |
|------|-------------|
| %    | Sets the font-size relative to the current font-size |
| em   | Relative to the font-size of the element |
| rem  | Relative to the browser base font-size |
| px   | Absolute font-size in pixels |
| vh   | Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport |
| vw   | Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport |

## Requirements
You have been tasked to create a personal site for a local art gallery showcasing digital forms of abstract art using CSS. Hereâ€™s what you need to include:
- Use grid or flex.
- Use three various types of CSS units.
- Ensure it works on all screen sizes, including:
  - Desktop: 1680 x 1050
  - iPad: 1024 x 768
  - Mobile: 480 x 320
- You must use z-index and hierarchical selectors in the code.
- Use common shorthand where applicable.
- Add an HTML form to collect the names and emails of interested visitors. 
  - It should have a submit button, and the form's action will take the user to another HTML page (the form does not actually need to collect information; you can assign a value to the `<form>` action attribute).

Please upload your files (`Picasso.html`, `external.css`, `formsubmitted.html`) to Canvas or a GitHub link (make sure it is set to public). It is important to submit something before the next class session, even if you are not done.

After you submit your work, feel free to open your professional journal and add an entry for any challenges faced, strengths identified, or experiences that built your confidence during this activity.
