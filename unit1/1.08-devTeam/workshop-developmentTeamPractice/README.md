## Pair Programming

### Simple Resume
Use pair programming to complete the following tasks: 
1. Decide which partner is going to be the **Driver** and which is the **Navigator**. 
2. Have the **Driver** open their IDE and create a file named `resume.html`.
3. The **Driver** should use HTML to create a simple resume, while the **Navigator** assists.
   - **NOTE:** A simple resume might consist of a large heading (containing your name), several smaller headings for different categories of experience, and bullet points describing highlights from that experience. You do not have to use real text for this exercise -- you can use **Lorem Ipsum**!
4. Move on when your website successfully renders a resume.

### Tic Tac Toe
Use pair programming to complete the following tasks: 
1. Switch roles as **Driver** and **Navigator**.
2. Have the **Driver** open their IDE and create a file named `tictactoe.html`.
3. The **Driver** should use a combination of `divs` and `spans` to achieve a Tic Tac Toe board that looks like this:
   ```plaintext
   O X O
   O X O
   X O X

# Personal Website Project
