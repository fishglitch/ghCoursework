## Overview
In this workshop, you will create a simple single-page application using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Documentation can be found here:
- [HTML: HyperText Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
- [CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

## Setup
1. Open VS Code.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar and search for "Live Preview."
3. Install the Live Preview extension.
4. Create two files: `index.html` and `index.css`.
5. In `index.html`, use the shortcut `Shift + 1` to generate an HTML template.
6. Link your CSS file in the `<head>` section:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
   ```

## HTML Basics
HTML uses tags to create elements. You will use the `<body>` tag to write your code. Add the following inside the `<body>` tags:
```html
<h1>My first HTML page</h1>
<p>I am a student</p>
<p>I love to learn!</p>
```
Your `<body>` tags should look like this:
```html
<body>
   <h1>My first HTML page</h1>
   <p>I am a student</p>
   <p>I love to learn!</p>
</body>
```
Right-click the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server** to view your page in the browser. Remember to save your changes often.

## Adding CSS
You can change the styles of your page by targeting tags in your CSS file.
1. Change the background color of the `<body>`:
   ```css
   body {
       background-color: green;
   }
   ```
2. Style the `<h1>` tag:
   ```css
   h1 {
       text-decoration: underline;
       text-align: center;
       color: antiquewhite;
   }
   ```
Refresh the browser to see the updates.

## Take It From Here
Take a screenshot of your webpage showing the heading and paragraph text and submit it for the assignment. Review the documentation to add more text and styles:
