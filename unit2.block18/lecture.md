Importance of Testing

ensure code is reliable, HQ, bug-free

JS testing
- identify issues early - break things early
- reduces debugging time
- make a change, test it.

Test Driven Development
a software development process that follows an iterative cycle
write a little test, write some code, do the test, good to go

1. Write a test spec
2. Run all existing tests
3. They should fail
4. write code passes tests
5. run tests and see what fails
6. refactor and clean up code
7. repeat

FAILURE IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 

Unit Testing - looking at a tiny piece of code. an individual unit of code. check the functionality of a function or class.
Integration - two modules and we see that they are working together appropriately (HTML . JS) 
functional test - end to end testing. we are pretending that we are a user and we are going through an entire flow.
acceptance - the application meets all of the identified requirements. 

Manual vs Automated Testing

Manual - carried out by QA role. more costly, long term. pretending you are user using the application. 
Automated - scripting

combo of both: high Q, reliable, bug-free code.
Popular Testing Libraries: 

Mocha 
Jasmine
Cypress
Playwright (sp?)


What Jess likes in QA- testing is bw-- pass/fail. When you create your own test suite, you think of how you can break it yourself. 

Jest is a popular test framework- open source, built on JS, streamlines front end unit tests

Testing Resources 

Writing Unit Tests 
1. read the problem
2. identify expectations
3. write pseudocode
4. 


Expectations
Happy Path - best case scenario my user understand how this app works, they know what to input, 
Unhappy
